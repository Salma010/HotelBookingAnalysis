# HotelBookingAnalysis
The "Hotel Booking Analysis" dashboard provides insights into hotel booking patterns, cancellations, and guest behavior. Here’s a post-analysis breakdown based on each visual element:

Key Metrics
Total Special Requests: 68,000 – This figure indicates the total count of special requests made by guests, suggesting a need for personalized services.
Cancellations: 44,000 – This high cancellation rate could imply issues with booking policies, customer satisfaction, or fluctuating guest plans.
Repeated Guests: 3,810 – Relatively low compared to total bookings, indicating a potential area to improve guest loyalty and retention strategies.
Lead Time Analysis
The line graph shows Average Lead Time by Arrival Date Week Number. The trend rises through the year, peaking around the middle weeks and dropping towards the year-end. This suggests that guests generally book farther in advance in mid-year, likely correlating with peak holiday seasons.

Customer Type and Stay Patterns
The bar chart illustrates the Average Stays in Weekend and Week Nights by Customer Type:
Transient guests tend to have longer stays in week nights compared to other customer types, hinting at business travelers who book short stays during the week.
Contract guests show relatively balanced weekend and weeknight stays.
Transient-Party guests, typically group travelers, have shorter stays.

Country and Market Segment
The map plot displays bookings by country and market segment. A diverse spread across continents highlights the global reach of the hotel, with market segments such as Corporate, Aviation, Groups, and Online TA (Travel Agencies). This segmentation can help the hotel tailor marketing efforts based on region and booking source.

Cancellation vs. Repeated Guest
The pie chart shows the ratio of cancellations vs. repeated guests. Cancellations make up the vast majority (92.07%) compared to repeat guests (7.93%), suggesting high churn. This indicates a need for strategies like flexible booking options or incentives to reduce cancellations.

Recommendations
Reduce Cancellations: Investigate the reasons behind the high cancellation rate, possibly by reviewing booking policies or conducting customer surveys.
Enhance Guest Retention: Develop loyalty programs and targeted campaigns for repeat guests.
Segmented Marketing: Tailor marketing efforts for different regions and customer types based on booking trends and lead times.
Optimize Services for Business Travelers: With a large transient customer base, enhancing business facilities might improve satisfaction and increase repeat bookings.
Overall, the dashboard highlights key areas for improving guest satisfaction, increasing repeat business, and reducing cancellations through targeted strategies.
